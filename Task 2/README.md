Hotel Management System: Adherence to SOLID Principles 
Introduction 
The Hotel Management System is designed to manage hotel operations, including room 
booking, payment processing, and record maintenance. The code structure follows the 
SOLID design principles to ensure a flexible, maintainable, and scalable architecture. 
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) 
Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one 
job or responsibility. 
Implementation: - Room Class: Focuses on room details and status, handling methods like book() and 
checkout(). - Customer Class: Manages customer-related information, such as name, contact details, and 
assigned room. - Hotel Class: Acts as the main system coordinator, responsible for booking rooms, 
displaying records, and handling payments. - Payment Classes: Each payment method class (BkashPayment, RocketPayment, etc.) 
handles its specific payment logic. 
By adhering to SRP, each class has a clear, focused responsibility, simplifying maintenance 
and reducing code complexity. 
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) 
Definition: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
Implementation: - The PaymentMethod Interface allows the addition of new payment methods without 
modifying existing code. For example, adding a new payment class (NewPaymentService) 
only requires implementing the PaymentMethod interface. - The Hotel Class can handle various room types and services through easily extensible 
methods, such as bookRoom() and showMenu(), without altering the existing logic. 
This structure makes it easy to extend the system's functionality without risking existing 
features. 
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 
Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without 
affecting the program's correctness. 
Implementation: - All PaymentMethod implementations (BkashPayment, RocketPayment, etc.) can be used 
interchangeably. The processPayment() method is called in the same way, regardless of the 
specific payment class used. - This ensures that the Hotel Class can work seamlessly with any payment method, adhering 
to LSP. 
The uniform behavior of payment classes guarantees that substitutions wonâ€™t break the 
program. 
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 
Definition: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. 
Implementation: - The system uses specific interfaces: BookingService, RoomService, RecordService, and 
PaymentMethod. Each interface defines a distinct set of methods that are relevant to a 
particular service. - For example, RoomService only declares showMenu(), ensuring that the implementing 
classes do not have to include unnecessary methods. 
By breaking down interfaces, the system becomes more flexible, and classes only implement 
methods they require. 
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 
Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should 
depend on abstractions. 
Implementation: - The Hotel Class depends on the PaymentMethod interface, not on concrete payment 
classes. This abstraction allows the payment mechanism to be easily changed or extended. - Dependency injection could be applied to further decouple classes and make testing more 
straightforward. 
Using abstractions for payment processing promotes a loosely coupled design, enhancing 
testability and maintainability. 
Conclusion 
The Hotel Management System is designed with a solid architecture that adheres to SOLID 
principles. This design choice enhances code clarity, flexibility, and extensibility, making it 
suitable for future expansion and easier maintenance.
